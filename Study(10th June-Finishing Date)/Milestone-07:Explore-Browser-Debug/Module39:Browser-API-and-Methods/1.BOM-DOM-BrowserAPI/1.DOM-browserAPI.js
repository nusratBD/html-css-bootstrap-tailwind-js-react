/* 
DOM: Document Object Model. It works with browser not with the JS.
Example: document.getElementById('test');

It is called DOM(Document Object Model), because it is similar to object property access. 
Example: 
const self = {
    name: 'Nusrat',
    age: 25
}
access: self.name;
*/

/* 
As DOM works only in browser, it is called browser API.
